Best Pace and Corral Calculator for New York Road Runners Races

This project is a calculator that calculates a runner's "best pace" and corral based off of a road race that they have ran. After inputting their race time and the distance of the race, it calculates their best pace
(which is calculated by taking their race time, adjusting it to a 10 K time, and taking the per mile pace of the 10 K) and corral according to the methods and times listed on the New York Road Runners website. The New
York Road Runners website is listed below:

This calculator is for people who are curious to see which corral they are in and what their best pace is. They can also input a target time and see the resulting best pace and corral that they will be upgraded to if
they hit their target time. 

To use this calculator, simply copy the repository and open the index.html file in a browser.
